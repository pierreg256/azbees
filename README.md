# azbeesLong story short, I was looking for a "bees with machine guns" clone that was working on Microsoft Azure. After hours serching and browsing : no love. I therefore decides to create myself a very minimaost Azure compatible version of it.## Installation1. If you don't already have it, [get node.js](https://nodejs.org).2. Clone the repo```git clone https://github.com/pierreg256/azbees.git```3. then install all the dependencies```cd azbeesnpm install```And you're good to go!## Configurationazbees uses your Azure credentials to connect and deploy ressources on the Azure cloud. To get your credentials, please create a principal using the Azure portal and fetch te following information:* Subscription ID* Client ID* Client Password* Tenant IDCreate an Azure service principal either through    [Azure CLI](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal-cli/),    [PowerShell](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal/)    or [the portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/).configure your azbees connection with the following command:```$ azbees config -b SUBSCRIPTION_ID -c CLIENT_ID -s CLIENT_SECRET -t TENANT> Successfully stored config in the following file: azbees.config ```alternatively you can provide a `JSON` config file named `azbees.config` and with  the following format : ```javascript{  "clientId": "d945278b-42e1-4e80-a651-sampleclientid",  "clientSecret": "YsKN2VmDP3secretsecretsecret/yvtZw=",  "tenant": "72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-sampletenant",  "subscriptionId": "d9df0a1a-1c52-47f2-a715-samplesubscriptionid"}```
